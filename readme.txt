Until the whole documentation will be written, this small guide will take its place.

Installing:

 - Download MudBot and any modules you wish to use.
 - Run mb-core. First run should create a config.txt file, which you can modify.
 - Connect with your MUD client at host 'localhost' port '123' (instead
   of 'imperian.com' port '23').
 - Log in.
(all commands are listed under "`help", and note that ` is NOT the apostrophe)


Using the Voter module:

 - Type 'vote'.
 - Type 'vote'.
 - Repeat steps 1 and 2 as often as you can.
(all options are listed under "vote help")


Using the IMapper module:

 - If your room title's color is not the default brown, use the 'map color' command.
 - Go in a place that is most likely mapped, and 'look'.
 - If the area's name is shown, the 'map' command can be used.
 - Experiment with the 'room find <name>', 'map path <vnum>' and 'go'/'stop'
   commands.
(all commands are listed under "map help")


Using the Imperian module:

 - Edit the "options" file, and set everything to your needs.
 - Also edit the "data" file if that wasn't enough.
 - If you want auto-curing, type `s3, or set the "level" option on 3.
(all commands are listed under "`h")
