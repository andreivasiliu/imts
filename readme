1. Introduction
===============

The Imperian Modularized Trigger System, IMTS, is composed of the core
engine, MudBot, and various modules. The core starts listening on port
123, loads all the modules, then waits for a connection. Once a user
connected, it can connect further to a MUD server, and monitor/modify
everything that passes through. Every server line and every user command
are sent to the modules for processing, before being sent further.


2. Installing
=============

- Open modules.txt, and comment/uncomment any modules you wish or don't wish
to load.
- Run the MudBot executable (mb-core.exe)
