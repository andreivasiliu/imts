IMTS-unstable
=============

(MudBot:)
- Completely rewritten the way lines/prompts are parsed and sent to the
  modules for processing.
(Imperian:)
- Rat/spider worth parsing is working again, also added caiman, serpents
  and locusts.
- Impatience should stop trying to focus.
(IMapper:)
- Autolinking added, and enabled by default. Added an option to disable it.
- Floating MXP map window added. Go/Stop buttons added on it, too.
- Duplicate room detection while mapping, added.
- Merging of two identic rooms (duplicate) into one, added.
- Most Pathfinder bugs are now gone. This will mostly affect the wings room
  and Caanae sewer entrances.
- Added an option to disable pathfinding through sewers.
- Added room tags, and replaced the landmarks system with it.
- The 'landmarks' command can be used to list all rooms with a tag.
- 'map path' works with tags instead of vnums too. If more rooms have a
  given tag, 'go' will go to the nearest.
- Now possible to show two or more areas in a single 'map'.
- With the above feature, the parts of the arenas were joined together.
- Binary maps will no longer be generated if one doesn't already exist.
- Mapper help system added. Check 'mhelp index'.
(IOffense:)
- Script block/statement parser added, that supports, in order of creation...
- C-like comments and spacing.
- Local and Global string variables.
- Functions and alias functions.
- Argument passing to functions, and return values from functions or
  statements.
- Variable assignment using a statement's return value, the assignment itself
  being a statement that can be assigned to yet another variable, etc.
- Function call stack, allowing unlimited recursive calls.
- Comparison and concatenating of variables/strings.
- Negation, and's, and or's.



IMTS-5
======

(MudBot:)
- Descriptor handling updated, to allow multiple listening ports.
- Various small changes, for compatibility with the Nexus client.
- The Editor can now make use of Composer's contents, new item added in
  its Load menu.
- To go around a Rapture bug, MCCP will be temporarily disabled when needed.
  Zmud users will now see items dropped and games played, and the Editor
  should get the Composer's contents when it's supposed to, not later.
- If Windows chokes up on too much network data, MudBot will patiently wait
  instead of simply quitting. (You can now experience the full joys
  of "room find a"!)
- Logging is started/stopped with the `log command, and no longer
  when MudBot starts.
- MXP support added.
- Renamed modules.txt to config.txt, which is now generated if not found.
- Many other insignificant bug fixes.
- Probably many other new bugs, as always.
- The same sources will compile on Linux, Darwin and Windows. Also a blank.c
  file was added, that can be compiled as a module.
(IMapper:)
- Making use of MXP, the maps are now enhanced. Tooltip, left-click action
  and right-click menu added to the rooms on a "map".
- The room title will be marked with MXP tags, to make it work with Zmapper.
- All sense/locate abilities will mark the player on the "map" for five
  seconds, and their name, if known, will be shown on the MXP Tooltip.
- Binary maps will be generated, which are somewhat faster to load.
- "area off", the command which disabled pathfinding in an area, can now be
  given an area name instead of only changing the current area.
- Renamed "settings.mapper.txt" to "config.mapper.txt", it's easier for CVS to
  ignore all files beginning with "config."
- Added "title_mxp" and "map_mxp" to "map config".
- Wings room added, along with its GSE teleport message.
(Imperian:)
- MXP is enabled for the prompt, so custom prompts can make use of secure MXP
  tags.
- The option "can_kipup" (or `sak in-game) can be used to use 'kipup' instead
  of 'stand', in case you have at least one arm working.
- Multiple commands can be sent by a single defence, cure, or trigger, if they
  are separated by a semicolon.
- Some changes on pipe lighting, and defences that use pipes.
- Commands beginning with sit, such as SITARA, will now work.
- Trigger message for the pipe refiller fixed.
- Fixed tree not removing all afflictions, if nothing was cured.



IMTS-4
======

(MudBot:)
- Telnet negotiation handler rewritten.
- Can use the new authentication method for ATCP, and default switched
  from "Javaclient 2.4.8" to "MudBot 2.1".
- Can assume another identity over ATCP, which can be set in the 'modules.txt'
  file.
- Hostname and Port for Autoconnecting can be set in the 'modules.txt' file.
- User and Password for Autologin can be set in the 'modules.txt' file too.
(Imperian:)
- The Imperian module makes use of the 'experience to next level' value, and
  now has it in the custom prompt.
(IMapper:)
- On special exits, Alias checking doesn't crash when the Command it points to
  is NULL. (Thanks Brydian)
- Swimming over water bug properly fixed. Sorry about that.
- 'map path near <vnum>' added. Keep alertness up, folks.
- Multiple uni-directional exits leading to the same room can now be handled by
  the pathfinder. As a side effect though, pathfinding is a bit slower.
- Alertness fixed even further. Should always recognize a room name properly,
  and show ALL directions matching it.
- Speedwalking into a locked door will give a more unique message, so a client
  can trigger it to unlock the door.
- 'queue' and 'queue clear' changed to 'map queue' and 'map queue clear'.
- 'map swim' removed.
- 'map config' added, with the options: save, load, swim, wholist, alertness,
  locate, showarea.
- Landmarks are now saved and loaded from the config file.



IMTS-3
======

(MudBot:)
- MudBot no longer treats data received from the server as C strings, anywhere.
- GetString limit set, to prevent any buffer overflows. Not that they ever
  existed though...
- Replaced all occurrences of "\n\r" with "\r\n", in hope of making it more
  compatible with Zmud.
(IMapper:)
- Lines beginning with '<', '(', or any weird characters won't be considered
  room names.
- Who list changed.
- Survey will create an area or switch to an existing one, instead of updating
  the current area's name.
- 'area update' will make survey update an area's name, instead of switching
  it.
- 'map path' can take more arguments as vnums, and will bring you to the
  nearest vnum.
- 'exit special capture create' and 'exit special capture link <vnum>' added.
