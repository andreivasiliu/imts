IMTS-3
======

(MudBot:)
- MudBot no longer treats data received from the server as C strings, anywhere.
- GetString limit set, to prevent any buffer overflows. Not that they ever
existed though...
- Replaced all occurances of "\n\r" with "\r\n", in hope of making it more
compatible with Zmud.
(IMapper:)
- Lines beginning with '<', '(', or any weird characters won't be considered
room names.
- Who list changed.
- Survey will create an area or switch to an existing one, instead of updating the current area's name.
- 'area update' will make survey update an area's name, instead of switching it.
- 'map path' can take more arguments as vnums, and will bring you to the nearest vnum.
- 'exit special capture create' and 'exit special capture link <vnum>' added.


IMTS-4
======

(MudBot:)
- Telnet negotation handler rewritten.
- Can use the new authentication method for ATCP, and default switched from "Javaclient 2.4.8" to "MudBot 2.1".
- Can assume another identity over ATCP, which can be set in the 'modules.txt' file.
- Hostname and Port for Autoconnecting can be set in the 'modules.txt' file.
- User and Password for Autologin can be set in the 'modules.txt' file too.
(Imperian:)
- The Imperian module makes use of the 'experience to next level' value, and now has it in the custom prompt.
(IMapper:)
- Alias checking doesn't crash when the Command it points to is NULL. (Thanks Brydian)
- Swimming over water bug properly fixed. Sorry about that.
- 'map path near <vnum>' added. Keep alertness up, folks.
- Multiple uni-directional exits leading to the same room can now be handled by the pathfinder. As a side effect though, pathfinding is a bit slower.
- Alertness fixed even further. Should always recognize a room name properly, and show ALL directions matching it.
- Speedwalking into a locked door will give a more unique message, so a client can trigger it to unlock the door.
