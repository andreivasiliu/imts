IMTS-3
======

- MudBot no longer treats data received from the server as C strings, anywhere.
- GetString limit set, to prevent any buffer overflows. Not that they ever
existed though...
- Replaced all occurances of "\n\r" with "\r\n", in hope of making it more
compatible with Zmud.

- Lines beginning with '<', '(', or any weird characters won't be considered
room names.
- Who list changed.
- Survey will create an area or switch to an existing one, instead of
updating the current area's name.
- 'area update' will make survey update an area's name, instead of
creating/switching.
- 'map path' can take more arguments as vnums, and will bring you to the
nearest vnum.
- 'exit special capture create' and 'exit special capture link <vnum>' added.


IMTS-4
======

- Alias checking doesn't crash when the Command it points to is NULL.
- 'map path near <vnum>' added.
- Telnet negotation handler somewhat rewritten.
