: "Mapper Help File" mhelp "mhelp file" file

Oookay... So this is how it works.

The first line of an mhelp file begins with a colon. It contains a list of
possible names that can be used with "mhelp". The first name is also used as
the title. In THIS file that you're reading, there are four names, so there
are four ways to access this file:
  mhelp mapper help file
  mhelp mhelp
  mhelp mhelp file
  mhelp file

The next lines contain the help file itself. The end of an mhelp file is
marked by the beginning of the next... In other words, by a colon.

Any line that begins with the '#' symbol is a comment, and not displayed.
#This is a comment. Go ahead and type "mhelp mhelp", you won't see this.

All empty lines at the beginning and end of the file are removed completely.

For information on how to use colours, type "mhelp colours".

: "Help Index" index

This is the index! Or will be.

: "Colours" colors colour color

# Don't read this in an editor, read it with "mhelp colours". Else you'll
# get confused.

Colour codes start with the '^^' symbol. If you want the '^^' symbol itself
to be shown and not a colour, double it ('^^^^').

Normal:
  ^^r = ^rRed^x
  ^^g = ^gGreen^x
  ^^y = ^yYellow (or brown)^x
  ^^b = ^bBlue^x
  ^^m = ^mMagenta^x
  ^^c = ^cCyan^x
  ^^w = ^wWhite^x
Bright:
  ^^R = ^RRed^x
  ^^G = ^GGreen^x
  ^^Y = ^YYellow^x
  ^^B = ^BBlue^x
  ^^M = ^MMagenta^x
  ^^C = ^CCyan^x
  ^^W = ^WWhite^x

  ^^x = Reset back to normal
  ^^^^ = ^^

: end
